#### Facial Recognition and Classification using sklearn in Python

- The objective of this project is to solve the problems of “classification” and “verification” with a popular problem space of "face”.
- Some notable features :-
	- All the proposed algorithms have been applied to 3 datasets
		- Yale Face Dataset
		- Indian Movie Face Dataset
		- IIIT Cartoon Face Dataset

	- Visualization of data using different plots from Matplotlib
	
	- Use of various feature reduction techniques :-
		- PCA
		- KPCA
		- LDA
		- ResNet Features
		- VGG Features
	
	- Use of various classification techniques :-
		- Logistic Regression
		- SVM
		- Multiple Layer Perceptron
	
	- Comparison of different combinations of feature reduction and classification techniques using :-
		- F1 Score
		- Recall
		- Precision
